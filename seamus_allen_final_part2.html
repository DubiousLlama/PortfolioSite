<p><strong>What was your previous knowledge of HTML/CSS/Javascript?</strong></p>
<p>I understood the funademtnals of programming from working with python, and the very basics of html from working with wordpress, but overall my knowledge was very minimal.</p>

<p><strong>Did you use a template or did you build your portfolio from scratch?</strong></p>
<p>I used a free template I found, but wound up modifying it fairly heavily by the end.</p>

<p><strong>What was your most challenging part of your portfolio (ie, the template, artifacts, CSS, etc.)</strong></p>
<p>The template made use of a number of more adcvanced css and js concepts, so parsing those and working with them was a good challenge.</p>

<p><strong>How taking this class changed your view on Web Development? </strong></p>
<p>It has definitely made me feel more confident with it overall, as I really understand what is going on now.</p>

<p><strong>What would you recommend to future students taking this class?</strong></p>
<p>Find the resources that work well for you, and use them! Personally, I reccomend using VSCode + HTML/CSS checker and live local hosting extensions paired with GitHub Pages, and that made the whole process much easier. <br> Also, you learn a lot when you experiment, so don't be afraid to add things and see what you can do!</p>
